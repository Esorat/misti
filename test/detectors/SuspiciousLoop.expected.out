[HIGH] SuspiciousLoop: Potential infinite loop
test/detectors/SuspiciousLoop.tact:5:16:
  4 |         let i: Int = 0;
> 5 |         while (true) { // This should be flagged for an unbounded condition
                     ^
  6 |             i = i + 1;
Help: Avoid unbounded conditions in loops

[HIGH] SuspiciousLoop: Potential high-cost loop
test/detectors/SuspiciousLoop.tact:11:17:
  10 |     fun testRepeatHighCount() { 
> 11 |         repeat (1_000_001) { // This should be flagged for excessive iteration
                       ^
  12 |             let x = 1;

[HIGH] SuspiciousLoop: Potential high-cost loop
test/detectors/SuspiciousLoop.tact:19:21:
  18 |         while (i < 10) {
> 19 |             repeat (1_000_000) { // Should be flagged within nested loop
                           ^

[HIGH] SuspiciousLoop: Loop condition is always false
test/detectors/SuspiciousLoop.tact:27:12:
  26 |     let a: Int = 0;
> 27 |     while (false) { // Should be flagged for dead code
                  ^
  28 |         a = 10000000; true; 
Help: The condition is always false; therefore, the body will never execute
