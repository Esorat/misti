[HIGH] SuspiciousLoop: Potential infinite loop
test/detectors/SuspiciousLoop.tact:5:16:
  4 |         let i: Int = 0;
> 5 |         while (true) { // This should be flagged for an unbounded condition
                     ^
  6 |             i = i + 1;

[HIGH] SuspiciousLoop: Potential high-cost loop
test/detectors/SuspiciousLoop.tact:11:17:
  10 |     fun testRepeatHighCount() { 
> 11 |         repeat (1_000_001) { // This should be flagged for excessive iteration
                       ^
  12 |             let x = 1;

[HIGH] SuspiciousLoop: Loop condition is always false
test/detectors/SuspiciousLoop.tact:34:12:
  33 |     let a: Int = 0;
> 34 |     while (false) { // Should be flagged for infinite loop
                  ^
  35 |         a = 10000000; true; 
Help: Consider removing the loop if there is no logic error
